## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm really excited to share that I've officially graduated from the Northcoders Data Engineering bootcamp! It's fair to say that I made a massive gamble deciding to leave a rewarding career in recruitment and decide to start coding with no coding background. But luckily enough I've enjoyed every second of it!

Although it seems like only yesterday when I first learnt what a 'string' and a 'variable' was, it's crazy to think about how much I've learned about so many different pieces of amazing technology in such a short space of time.

Here are some of the things to know about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve learnt so much! After initially completing a small coding entry challenge for my course based in JavaScript, I started the course and began learning fundamental functional and object-oriented programming in Python. I then moved on to learning all things database related, including creating and interacting with PostgreSQL databases via SQL queries as well as using Pandas for transformation and analytics. Then came APIs and the Cloud! I learned the basics of live interaction with third party APIs using FastAPI, utilising Test-Driven-Development practices throughout to test all aspects of my responses and status codes. I then learned the basics of Infrastucture-As-Code and how to properly configure IAM roles, policies as well as Lambda permissions and cloudwatch logs for AWS and storing objects in S3 Buckets. Everything was then tied up to a conclusion in the form of a project - https://github.com/BenMorgan99/northcoders_final_project_25.git 
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to expand on my newly found skillset. I plan to work on various other smaller projects by myself to keep my programming skills sharp and ready for the professional world. I'm also very interested in learning other backend languages such as Java, C and would be very keen to rekindle my relationship with JavaScript.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything and everything! The more code I can sink my teeth into, the better!
  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding work and project inspiration.
  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about why I got into Tech and what industries I'd love to make a difference in.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I've donated 18 pints of blood in total. Not all at once though of course!
